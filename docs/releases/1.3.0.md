## Resolved Issues
- Fixed issue for Sweden as All Saints Day was always calculated to be on November 1st. However the holiday has always 
  been celebrated on a Saturday (between October 31 and November 6th).
- Fixed the getProviders as it was not able to load Holiday Providers defined in (sub) regions [#5879133](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/commit/58791330ccf5c13b1626885921534c32866b7faf) ([R2c](https://github.com/R2c))
- Fixed issue that it was possible for the AbstractProvider class to be loaded as a Holiday Provider [#9678bc4](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/commit/9678bc490e34980404ad5dc5b3d45a3c76a3ca0f) ([R2c](https://github.com/R2c))
- Corrected incorrect pathname reference *BaseTestCase.php files (&quot;Test&quot; -&gt; &quot;test).
- Fixed issue for France as Good Friday and St. Stephens Day were defined as official holidays. These aren&#039;t national
  holidays and are only observed in the French departments Moselle, Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin. With this fix, these 
  holidays have been removed from the France Holiday providers and new providers for the departments Moselle, Bas-Rhin 
  and Haut-Rhin are added. [#17](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/17) ([R2c](https://github.com/R2c))
- Updated locales list based on CLDR version 29. Removed locales of which the region identifier is not specified.
- Fixed issue for Sweden as Midsummer&#039;s Day (st. Johns Day) was always calculated to be on June 24th. However the 
  holiday has always been celebrated on a Saturday (between June 20 and June 26).
- Fixed base test for some Spain/LaRioja as some holidays have been established only in a particular year, causing
  false failures in the unit tests.
- Running php-cs-fixer fix . --level=psr2 generated a massive list of changes, and broke unit tests. Added a custom
  .php_cs config file to adhere to the PSR-2 Coding Standards and resolve this issue. In addition the php-cs-fixer 
  command to has been added to composer to run the fixers and on the CI server (Travis), meaning PRâ€™s will need to be 
  PSR2 compliant before they can be merged. If any files do not pass, the build fails. [#15](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/15) [#16](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/16) ([badams](https://github.com/badams))
- Accidentally the timezone for Norway was set to &quot;Europe/Copenhagen&quot;. This has been corrected to &quot;Europe/Oslo&quot;. [#11](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/11) [#12](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/12) ([badams](https://github.com/badams))
- Fixed issue for Finland as Midsummer&#039;s Day (st. Johns Day) was always calculated to be on June 24th. However since 
  1955, the holiday has always been celebrated on a Saturday (between June 20 and June 26).
