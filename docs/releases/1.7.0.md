# Yasumi v1.7.0 Release Notes

_Released on December 11, 2017_

A new release was long overdue and v1.7.0 has some nice enhancements... Four new countries have been added (Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Switzerland) making the total of holiday providers 96! (31 countries and 65 sub-regions). 

Instead of giving the country name as a parameter, you can now also use the ISO3166_2 code to instantiate a Holiday object, which in some cases makes more sense. Also, all filters implement the Countable interface so you can use the -&gt;count() method, which will return the correct number of (filtered) holidays.

Heads up! v1.7.0 will be the last release supporting PHP5.x. PHP7 has been out for a long time and Yasumi can definitely benefit from the new features in PHP7. Likely the PHP7 only branch will start as v2.0.0. 

As always a big thanks to all the contributors!

- Holiday Provider for Hungary. #57 ([AronNovak](https://github.com/AronNovak))
- Holiday Provider for Switzerland. #56 ([qligier](https://github.com/qligier))
- All filters implement the Countable interface allowing you to use the -&gt;count() method. #77
- Sometimes it is more convenient to be able to create a Yasumi instance by ISO3166 code rather than Yasumi&#039;s Holiday Provider name. A new function createByISO3166_2 has been added to allow for that. #62 ([huehnerhose](https://github.com/huehnerhose))
- Missing translations (de_DE) for Easter Sunday and Whitsunday. #60 ([IceShack](https://github.com/IceShack))
- Made calculate method public and use of proper camel casing. #73 ([patrickreck](https://github.com/patrickreck))
- Upgraded Faker Library to version 1.7
- Renamed the holiday type NATIONAL to OFFICIAL. Subregions may have official holidays and the name NATIONAL doesn&#039;t suit these situations. #65
- Upgraded PHP-CS-Fixer to version 2.6

**Resolved Issues:**
- Corrected Geneva (Switzerland) unit test to ensure some holidays that are established at a particular year are handled as such.
- Repentance Day is an official holiday in Saxony (Germany) #63
- Corrected the Easter Sunday translation for Austria (de_AT) #66

- Added missing Summer Bank Holiday for the United Kingdom. #64
