# Yasumi v1.2.0 Release Notes

_Released on April 4, 2016_

## Implemented Enhancements
- Added Holiday Provider for Denmark
- Added Holiday Provider for Norway
- Added Holiday Provider for Sweden
- Added Holiday Provider for Finland
- New function &#039;isWorkingDay&#039; added that determines whether a date represents a working day or not. A working day is 
  considered a date that is neither a holiday nor falls into the weekend.
- Refactoring and cleanup of unit tests

## Closed Issues
- The Vernal Equinox Day and Autumnal Equinox Day in Japan were excluded from having it substituted for another day in
  case these days would fall on the weekend.
- Fixed tests for some holiday providers as some holidays have been established only in a particular year, causing
  false failures in the unit tests.
