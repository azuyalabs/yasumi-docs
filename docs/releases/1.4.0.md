# Yasumi v1.4.0 Release Notes

_Released on June 4, 2016_

**Implemented enhancements:**
- Added Holiday Provider for Brazil. [#21](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/21) ([dorianneto](https://github.com/dorianneto))
- Added Holiday Provider for the Czech Republic. [#26](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/26) ([dfridrich](https://github.com/dfridrich))
- Added Holiday Provider for the United Kingdom. [#23](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/23)
- Add Welsh language (spoken in Wales, UK) translations for the holidays in the United Kingdom [#25](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/25) ([meigwilym](https://github.com/meigwilym))
- All Holiday Provider must now implement a code that will identify it. Typically this is the ISO3166 code 
  corresponding to the respective country or subregion. This can help for purposes such as translations or interfacing 
  with other API&#039;s for example.
- To determine a set of holidays between two dates you can now use the aptly named &#039;between()&#039; method.

**Resolved issues:**
- Fixed an issue with the unit test for the &#039;getProviders&#039; method failing on Windows. Hardcoded unix-style directory separators have been replaced by DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR. [#30](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/30) ([navarr](https://github.com/navarr))
- Corrected a typo in the English translation for 敬老の日 (Japan) [#22](https://github.com/azuyalabs/Yasumi/pull/22) ([navarr](https://github.com/navarr))
- Fixed issue that the unit tests in &#039;YasumiTest&#039; (methods &#039;next&#039; and &#039;previous&#039;) didn&#039;t cover the situations that the limits are exceeded. [#28](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/28)
