  [\#314](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/314) ([barami](https://github.com/barami))

* Simplify the calculation of Carnival in Argentina, Brazil and the Netherlands to reduce duplication.

## Resolved Issues
* For South Korea, some of the past dates for Buddha&#039;s Day, Chuseok, Armed Forces Day
  and United Nations Day were incorrectly calculated during for certain periods. [\#314](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/314) ([barami](https://github.com/barami))
* The holiday `twoDaysLaterNewYearsDay` of South Korea has been removed from 1990, however the unit test for the name
  and holiday type allowed the possible testing range to include the year 1990.
* New Years Day tests for South Korea were failing due to incorrect date checks.
* The Easter Date calculation resulted in wrong values for the year 2025, due to an incorrect rounding for the lunar
  correction when the calendar extension is not used. [#326](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/326) ([rChassat](https://github.com/rChassat))
  
## Removed
* Denmark will abolish Great Prayer Day (&#039;store bededag&#039;) from 2024. [#308](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/308) ([c960657](https://github.com/c960657))
* Summertime and Wintertime in the Netherlands and Denmark as these can&#039;t be reliably established for historical dates and
  aren&#039;t true holidays in the context of Yasumi. Refer to this [discussion](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/discussions/321)
  for further details and rationale. [#322](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/322)
* PHP 7.4 support.
