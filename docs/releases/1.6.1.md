# Yasumi v1.6.1 Release Notes

_Released on February 7, 2017_

This bugfix release addresses some minor annoying issues, so unfortunately no new features this time.

**Implemented enhancements:**
- Moved Reformation Day to Christian Holidays as it is not only celebrated in Germany.
- Added missing unit tests for the German Unit Day for each German state.

**Resolved issues:**
- Fixed Christmas Day and Boxing Day for the United Kingdom. A substitute bank holiday is now created for both Christmas and Boxing Day when either of those days fall on a weekend. [#48](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/issues/48) ([joshuabaker](https://github.com/joshuabaker))
- Renamed &#039;en_US&#039; translation for the Second Christmas Day (from ‘Boxing Day’ to ‘Second Christmas Day’: Boxing Day concept does not exist in the US). [#53](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/53) ([AngelinCalu](https://github.com/AngelinCalu))
- Created fallback calculation of the easter_days function in case the PHP extension &#039;calendar&#039; is not loaded. [#55](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/55) ([stelgenhof](https://github.com/stelgenhof))
- Added missing unit tests for Reformation Day as in 2017 it is celebrated in all German states for its 500th anniversary.
- Changed Travis configuration to use Composer-installed phpunit to avoid if any issues arise with globally installed phpunit.
