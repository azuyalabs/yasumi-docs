# Yasumi v2.1.0 Release Notes

_Released on March 29, 2019_

A couple of months after the successful v2 release, a new minor release is available as of today. Yasumi v2.1 addresses mostly a few issues for the Japan Holiday Provider and some other bug fixes. 

**Implemented enhancements**
- As the Japanese Emperor will abdicate the throne on May 1st 2019, the holiday of the Emporers Birthday will change to February 23rd from 2020 (No holiday in 2019). In addition, Coronation Day and the Enthronement Proclamation Ceremony will be extra holidays in 2019.

- International Women&#039;s Day is an official holiday since 2019 in Berlin (Germany). [#133](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/133) ([huehnerhose](https://github.com/huehnerhose))

**Resolved issues**
- Japanese Health And Sports Day will be renamed to Sports Day from 2020. [\#129](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/129) ([cookie-maker](https://github.com/cookie-maker))
- Dutch spelling for Easter/Pentecost/Christmas to use lower case. [\#128](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/128) ([c960657](https://github.com/c960657))
- Refactored the Netherlands Holiday provider by moving the calculation of individual holidays to private methods. This will reduce the complexity of the initialize method.
- Visibility of internal class functions to &#039;private&#039;. These are to be used within the class only and should not be public.
- &quot;Bridge Day&quot; for Japan takes two days in 2019. Currently the code only allows for 1 bridge day at a maximum. [\#141](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/141) ([cookie-maker](https://github.com/cookie-maker))
- Tests for Bremen, Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein (Germany) also celebrated Reformation Day in 2017. The unit tests were failing as it didn&#039;t account for that.
- Changed the USA Provider to check all holidays for potential substitute holidays, not just New Year&#039;s Day, Independence Day, and Christmas Day. [\#140](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/140) ([jagers](https://github.com/jagers))
- Adjusted tests for the &#039;next&#039; and &#039;previous&#039; methods to avoid actually exceeding the year boundaries.
- Deprecation warning for the package mikey179/vfStream. Composer 2.0 requires package names to not contain any upper case characters. [\#135](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/135) ([IceShack](https://github.com/IceShack))
- Incorrect comment about weekends in India [\#126](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/126) ([c960657](https://github.com/c960657))
- Correction to the test of New Year&#039;s day in the United Kingdom. It has been identified as a Bank Holiday only since 1975 (not from 1974).
- Duplicate definition of newYearsDay [\#125](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/125) ([c960657](https://github.com/c960657))
