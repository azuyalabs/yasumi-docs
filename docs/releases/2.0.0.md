# Yasumi v2.0.0 Release Notes

_Released on January 11, 2019_

Almost a year has passed since the release of v1.8.0, but finally it is here: **Yasumi v2.0.0**!

Upgraded entirely to PHP version 7 with PHP 7.1 being the minimum required version. Base code and all unit tests have been reworked to compatibility with PHP 7. This also means support of PHP 5 has now come to an end.
