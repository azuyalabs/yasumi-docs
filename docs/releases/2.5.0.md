# Yasumi v2.5.0 Release Notes

_Released on January 30, 2022_

It is that time again; the time for a new release!

We have two more countries, and for a few countries new holidays are added, or regulations have been revised. Even more importantly, support for PHP 7.3 has been dropped, so all the more reason to upgrade to version 2.5.

The documentation site has undergone a few changes, specifically to support readers with disabilities. And lastly, head over to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/discussions) to ask questions or share your ideas.

Below you will find a summary of the most significant changes. For more details, please check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file of this project or navigate to the [v2.5 release](https://www.yasumi.dev/blog/release_v25/) blog post.
