# Yasumi v1.8.0 Release Notes

_Released on February 21, 2018_

Yasumi v1.8.0 is now available as of Wednesday, February 21st supporting Russia and Estonia thanks to the work of [Gedas Luko≈°ius](https://github.com/lukosius).  

As already announced in my previous [post](https://www.yasumi.dev/blog/hello-time), 1.8.0 will be the last release to officially support PHP5.x. I think it&#039;s about time that Yasumi will fully support PHP7 using its performance improvements.

Next to Russia and Estonia being part of the family, 1.8.0 includes a good number of fixes and changes as well.

**Implemented enhancements:**
- Added a function that can remove a holiday from the holidays providers (i.e. country/state) list of holidays. This function can be helpful in cases where an existing holiday provider class can be extended but some holidays are not part of the original (extended) provider.
- Changed various functions that have a date parameter to support now objects implementing the DateTimeInterface and objects of the DateTimeImmutable type. 
- Added support for countries where the weekend definition (start and end day) differs from the global definition (Saturday and Sunday).
- Holiday Provider for Russia. [\#72](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/72) ([lukosius](https://github.com/lukosius))
- Holiday Provider for Estonia. [\#71](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/71) ([lukosius](https://github.com/lukosius))
- Added Scrutinizer integration.
- Locale List updated based on CLDR version 32. 
- Added PHPStan static analysis tool to Travis CI [\#88](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/88) ([lukosius](https://github.com/lukosius))
- Various inline documentation enhancements. [\#87](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/87) ([lukosius](https://github.com/lukosius))
- Removed unnecessary typecasts and if-construct. [\#87](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/87) ([lukosius](https://github.com/lukosius))
- Updated inline documentation to include correction Exception throws.
- Removed unnecessary NULL checks.

**Resolved Issues:**
- Fixed Brazilian Carnaval Day and added Ash Wednesday to Brazilian Holidays. [\#92](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/92) ([glauberm](https://github.com/glauberm))
- Yasumi listed 01.04.2018 (Easter Sunday) for Spain as an official holiday, however it is not recognized as such. Fix made that recognizes Easter Sunday as being observed (in all regions). [\#86](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/86) ([Bastian Konetzny](https://github.com/bkonetzny))
- Corrected reference to the Holiday Provider&#039;s ID to be static.
- Changed weekend data property into constant as it is not dynamic (runtime). 
- Corrected the name translation test for the Restoration of Independence Day (Portugal). The test didn&#039;t account for the fact that this holiday was abolished and reinstated at some time.
- Corrected unit test for Geneva (Switzerland) as the jeune Genevois day was incorrectly asserted as a regional holiday.
- Corrected the count logic so that in case a holiday is substituted (or observed), it is only counted once.
- Dropped unnecessary arguments of some methods in various Holiday Providers.
- Corrected Japanese &quot;Green Day&quot; and &quot;Children&#039;s Day&quot; to use &quot;Hiragana&quot; instead of Kanji. [\#80](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi/pull/80) ([cookie-maker](https://github.com/cookie-maker))
