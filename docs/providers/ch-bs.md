    The below listed holidays (and the aforementioned number of holidays) merely reflect which holidays are registered
    with the Basel-Stadt provider in Yasumi. These do not indicate whether a particular holiday is
    considered a non-working day or not.

    Although Yasumi has the ability to classify holidays (e.g. 'Official', 'Regional', etc.), this isn't optimal
    feature and we are working on a different classification system.
