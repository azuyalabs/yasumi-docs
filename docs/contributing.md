# Contributing

Welcome to the contribution guide for Yasumi. Contributions are encouraged and welcome, and are accepted
via pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/azuyalabs/yasumi "GitHub"). When contributing to Yasumi,
there are a few guidelines to keep in mind.

## Which branch?

- Please submit all pull requests for new features to the 'develop' branch.
- Please submit pull requests for bug fixes and typos to the earliest branch the issue can be found in.

## Guidelines

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/ "PSR-12 Coding Standard")**
  Please use the following command after you have completed your work:

  ``` shell
  composer format
  ```

  This will check/correct all the code for the PSR-12 Coding Standard using the
  wonderful [php-cs-fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/ "PHP-CS-Fixer").

- **Add unit tests!** - Your Pull Request won't be accepted if it does not have tests:

    1. Ensure your new Holiday Provider contains all the necessary unit tests.
    2. Next to the file `{REGIONNAME}BaseTestCase.php`, a file called `{REGIONNAME}Test.php` needs to be present. This
       file needs to include region/country level tests and requires assertion of all expected holidays.
    3. All the unit tests and the implementation Holiday Provider require to have the correct locale, timezone and
       region/country name.
    4. As almost all the tests use automatic iterations, so make sure the year for which the test is executed is a valid
       year. Some holidays only are established from a certain year and having the test year number lower than the
       minimum establishment year (amongst all holidays) can result in false errors.

- Ensure that the **current tests pass**, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.

- **Document any change** - Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` and any other relevant documentation reflect the changes.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to contribute more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make
  multiple intermediate commits while developing,
  please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History "Squash them") before submitting.

- You may also need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing "Rebase") to avoid merge
  conflicts.

- Remember that Yasumi follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/ "Semantic Versioning"). If you are changing
  the behaviour, or the public API, you may need to update the docs.
