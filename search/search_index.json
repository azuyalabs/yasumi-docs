Let's find out how easy with this basic exercise.</p> <p>We need to include Yasumi using the Composer autoloader first, then we can create a new holiday provider instance (we will be using the United States of America):</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\n// Use the factory to create a new holiday provider instance\n$holidays = Yasumi\\Yasumi::create('USA', (int) date('Y'));\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can access and use the various API methods of Yasumi. Let's see how many holidays the US has in 2025:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n// Get the number of defined holidays\necho $holidays-&gt;count() . PHP_EOL;\n\n// 11 (Substituted holidays are only accounted for once)\n</code></pre> <p>To get an overview of all the holidays of the US, we can simply loop through the results since each Yasumi Holiday Provider implements the ArrayIterator. Getting a list of holidays for the US with the internal short names can be obtained as follows:</p> <pre><code>// Get a list all of the holiday names (short names)\nforeach ($holidays-&gt;getHolidayNames() as $name) {\n    echo $name . PHP_EOL;\n}\n\n// `newYearsDay`\n// `martinLutherKingDay`\n// `washingtonsBirthday`\n// `memorialDay`\n// `juneteenth`\n// `independenceDay`\n// `labourDay`\n// `columbusDay`\n// `veteransDay`\n// `thanksgivingDay`\n// `christmasDay`\n</code></pre> <p>These short names are not the names used for display purposes: they are simply used as internal identifiers by Yasumi. Later we will see how we can use the (display) names of holidays we are typically used to.</p> <p>Now let's get all the holiday dates:</p> <pre><code>// Get a list all of the holiday dates\nforeach ($holidays-&gt;getHolidayDates() as $date) {\n    echo $date . PHP_EOL;\n}\n\n// 2025-01-01\n// 2025-01-20\n// 2025-02-17\n// 2025-05-26\n// 2025-06-19\n// 2025-07-04\n// 2025-09-01\n// 2025-10-13\n// 2025-11-11\n// 2025-11-27\n// 2025-12-25\n</code></pre> <p>Independence Day is an important holiday in the US. What details can Yasumi tell us about this holiday? Using the 'getHoliday' function we can retrieve information like the localized name, date and type of holiday of Independence Day:</p> <pre><code>// Get a holiday object for Independence Day\n$independenceDay = $holidays-&gt;getHoliday('independenceDay');\n\n// Get the localized name\necho $independenceDay-&gt;getName() .

PHP_EOL;\n\n// 'official'\n</code></pre> <p>Lastly, if you are a developer, you might be interested in getting the holiday information as a JSON object:</p> <pre><code>// Print the holiday as a JSON object\necho json_encode($independenceDay, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);\n\n// {\n//     \"shortName\": \"independenceDay\",\n//     \"translations\": {\n//         \"en\": \"Independence Day\"\n//     },\n//     \"date\": \"2025-07-04 00:00:00.000000\",\n//     \"timezone_type\": 3,\n//     \"timezone\": \"America\\/New_York\"\n// }\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"recipes/between_filter.html","title":"Holidays based on a given date range","text":"<p>Let's say you are running an online store, and you want to send shoppers a promotion e-mail about new seasonal products.

This new class will then contain modifications that reflect differences from the U.S. holidays.</p> <p>The custom holiday provider class will look like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n/**\n * Provider for all observed holidays by the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)\n */\nclass NYSE extends \\Yasumi\\Provider\\USA\n{\n    /**\n     * Initialize holidays for the NYSE.\n     * @throws \\Exception\n     */\n    public function initialize(): void\n    {\n        parent::initialize();\n\n        // Add Good Friday\n        $this-&gt;addHoliday($this-&gt;goodFriday($this-&gt;year, $this-&gt;timezone, $this-&gt;locale));\n\n        // Remove Columbus Day and Veterans Day\n        $this-&gt;removeHoliday('columbusDay');\n        $this-&gt;removeHoliday('veteransDay');\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here you can see, that we use Yasumi's <code>addHoliday</code> and <code>removeHoliday</code> methods to add Good Friday and, respectively, remove Columbus Day and Veterans Day from the internal list of defined holidays.</p> <p>Now we can instantiate a Yasumi Holiday Provider object with our new custom provider class:</p> <pre><code>// Use the factory method to create a new holiday provider instance\n$NYSEHolidays = Yasumi\\Yasumi::create(NYSE::class, 2025);\n</code></pre> <p>We then can retrieve the NYSE observed holidays in 2025 in the usual manner:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n// Display all holidays\nforeach ($NYSEHolidays as $day) {\n    echo $day-&gt;getName() . PHP_EOL;\n}\n\n// 'New Year\u2019s Day'\n// 'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s Birthday'\n// 'Washington\u2019s Birthday'\n// 'Good Friday'\n// 'Memorial Day'\n// 'Juneteenth'\n// 'Independence Day'\n// 'Labor Day'\n// 'Thanksgiving Day'\n// 'Christmas'\n</code></pre> <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n// Use the count() method to show how many holidays are returned\necho $NYSEHolidays-&gt;count() . PHP_EOL;\n\n// 10\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>count</code> method does not double count holidays that are observed. Hence, in the example above 10 holidays are counted.</p> <p>As you can see, Yasumi's open design allows even for scenarios that are atypical. Alternatively, you can also create custom filters, however these are best suited for situations when you only need to exclude holidays from a Holiday Provider.</p> <p>Sources:</p> <ul> <li>NYSE Holidays and Trading Hours</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recipes/filters.html","title":"Filter only certain holidays","text":"<p>Each Yasumi Holiday Provider contains many holidays that can be classified by different types. As you may want to select a specific set of holidays, Yasumi provides a number of filters that can help you with that. Yasumi comes currently with the following filters:</p> <ul> <li>Official - Holidays that are marked as public or statutory.</li> <li>Observed - Holidays that are not necessarily official however are being observed.</li> <li>Bank - A public holiday in the United Kingdom, some Commonwealth countries and some other European countries.</li> <li>Seasonal - Holidays that are celebrated due to its seasonal character (e.g. Halloween).</li> <li>Other - Holidays that fall outside any of the above type.</li> <li>Between - Filters all holidays between a given start and given end date. Check out   this recipe on how to use the Between filter.</li> <li>On - Filters all holidays that happen on a given date.</li> </ul> <p>So, how do we for example go about getting only the official holidays from Yasumi? In that case we can use the 'OfficialHolidaysFilter'.</p> <p>First, we start with the basics, using the Netherlands as an example:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\n// Require the composer auto loader\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\n// Use the factory to create a new holiday provider instance\n$holidays = Yasumi\\Yasumi::create('Netherlands', (int) date('Y'));\n</code></pre> <p>Then we include the following line to create the filter object for the official holidays:</p> <pre><code>$official = new Yasumi\\Filters\\OfficialHolidaysFilter($holidays-&gt;getIterator());\n</code></pre> <p>That's all it takes! Now, you can use the usual Yasumi API methods to process the holidays (which are now filtered). Which could look like this:</p> <pre><code>foreach ($official as $day) {\n    echo $day-&gt;getName() . PHP_EOL;\n}\n\n// 'New Year\u2019s Day'\n// 'Easter Sunday'\n// 'Easter Monday'\n// 'Kings Day'\n// 'Ascension Day'\n// 'Whitsunday'\n// 'Whitmonday'\n// 'Christmas'\n// 'Second Christmas Day'\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"releases/index.html","title":"Releases","text":"<p>Generally a new version of Yasumi is released whenever there are a significant number of features and fixes, or when there are critical (security) issues resolved.
